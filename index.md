I am an open university student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 4

  The reason I chose this lab is because it was my first exposure to a lab that can be applied in real life.  The practical nature of the subject matter also made me more interested, and it gives me greater motivation to improve my coding skills.

* Lab 11, part 2

   I chose Lab 11 part 2 because I had always been interested in such numerical games that I didn't realize it was actually quite easy to design such a program until after I finished the lab. Such topics also made me more interested in coding.

* Lab 12
 
  Lab12 is different from the labs I have done in the past. Its ultimate goal is to create an image with continuously changing colors, which is a completely new challenge for me. It's very interesting to me to complete the final work by overlaying different colors.
